# JSTypeMonitor

This is a simple monitor to check when changes happens on some HTML element.
It can be used to trigger some functions like autocompletion or filling other
elements with the watched element value. For autocompletion, it have a minimum
chars configuration which will only trigger the result function when it reachs
the minimum length.

It's vanilla JavaScript, we don't need any framework to make it works and it can
be used with all the frameworks.
